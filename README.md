# My Spotify

I listened to music on Spotify although not very frequently, but I am still curious about the type of music and the artist that I tend to listen more. Hence, as a data enthusiast, I utilize the Spotify api and some analytical tools to visualize my music records.

------

**Tools**

-- Python

-- Jupyter Notebook

-- Tableau 

------

**My Approach**

-- Download you Spotify record via Spotify account

-- Utilize Spotify API to grab detailed information of the songs

-- Python data cleaning and extracting

-- Tableau Dashboard

I focus on studying the features (Dancibility, Liveness, Loundness) in the songs and the artist, which can imply what category of songs you tend to listen more. Also from my dashboard, you can look into the records in every month and probably find out some songs that you listened a lot in that period but you didn't keep listening them. It helps me retrieve my fav songs that accidentally lost in my records!

**Spotify music features:**

acousticness: how acoustic

danceability: self-explanatory

energy: how 'fast, loud an noisy'

instrumentalness: the less vocals, the higher

liveness: whether there is audience in the recording

loudness: self-explanatory

speechiness: the more spoken words, the higher

valence: whether the track sounds happy or sad

tempo: the bpm
