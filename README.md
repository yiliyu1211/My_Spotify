## Visulaize my Spotify record

I listened to music on Spotify although not very frequently, but I am still curious about the type of music and the artist that I tend to listen more. Hence, as a data enthusiast, I utilize the Spotify api and some analytical tools to visualize my music records.

**Tools**

-- Python

-- Jupyter Notebook

-- Tableau 

**My Approach**

-- Download you Spotify record via Spotify account

-- Utilize Spotify API to grab detailed information of the songs

-- Python data cleaning and extracting

-- Tableau Dashboard

**Dashboard**
